# Few-Shot Chatbot

A web application that allows users to guide AI responses through examples rather than explicit instructions. This approach, known as few-shot learning, enables more precise control over the AI's output format and style.

## Core Features

- **Examples**: Input-output or name-content pairs that demonstrate the desired response patterns
- **Templates**: Reusable templates with fixed text and variable input sections
- **Conversation**: Simple chat interface to interact with the AI using defined examples

The application uses the Gemini API to provide AI responses but focuses on the few-shot prompting technique, where examples are provided in the prompt context to guide the AI's understanding of the desired response pattern.

Rather than giving complex instructions, users can simply show the AI what they want through examples, resulting in more consistent and predictable outputs that follow the demonstrated patterns.
